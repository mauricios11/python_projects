# World population: data exploration without pandas :no_entry_sign::panda_face::no_entry_sign:

#### By: :t-rex:Mauricios

The goal of this project is to prepare a raw dataset for data exploration.
In order to avoid having problems in future projects due to a lack of understanding of the operation of the tools used that are independent of the pandas implementation *The challenge is **not to use pandas** to better understand the inner workings of python syntax & other important modules*.


This is the dataset used for the project: [kaggle - World population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)
