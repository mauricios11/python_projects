# World population: data exploration without pandas :no_entry_sign::panda_face::no_entry_sign:

#### By: :t-rex:Mauricios

The goal of this project is to prepare a raw dataset for data exploration.

In order to avoid having problems in future projects due a lack of understanding of the operation of other python tools. *The challenge is **not use pandas***.


This is the dataset used for the project: [kaggle - World population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)
